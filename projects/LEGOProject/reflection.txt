Even while the final result having a miserable ending, this project was a
very educational and essential step in teamwork and working habits as a computer engineer.
Our groups teamwork ability blossomed and got stronger for each week.
The problem that came underways, teached us how to tinker, explore and handle difficult,
not yet solved things, which is an essential engineer ability in my opinion.
Nonetheless both building/tinkering and Python skills where further refined, which will
be necessary in the diverse subject we will encounter on the road.
