We started planning and sketch the basis of the robot. The robot was set to be a static
veichle, where limited time to our disposition made it more important to focus on the
actual functionality.
<br>
We once more split the team to ensure multitasking and expertize of each category. This time
were i on the building group while the others that previously did it, were programming or 
doing miscallaneous work, that being raport writing and helping out where necessary.
<br>
The build itself going really well, made me move to the programming team. They encountered
a big problem that wasn't solvable right away, which happened to take me in to the development team.
Scrapping the code so far, the focus went over to debugging. We quickly found out that
the sensor was made clearly for LEGO bricks, and detecting the minature indicators on the
pH-strip was a total failure.
<br>
Many hours were wasted on trying to solve our problem, but in the end we had to use a LEGO simulation
of indicator colors or just approximate to make any kind of result. This crushing result
had to just be accepted, because of the color sensors simplified nature. Even while everything was
sat up to the perfection, the fact that we're dealing with a introduction level LEGO
set meant we should not be attempting rocket science with it!
