Through a variation of sub-asignments we learned the basics of the robot,
like controlling motors and utilizing sensors for our benefit. The early
tasks were everything from simple manuvering, to controlled object-manuvering
and line following. In more detail, was the first asignment about driving in a square, and the second
was to imitate "Bernt", NTNU's grasscutter. The third and last oligatory task
was driving and doing random tasks while line-following on a test track. We quickly
progressed in great sucession, and went for the finale.

The first thing we set up was a group contract, that also included information about how
we should proceed for the final project. We put our goals in a prioritized list:
<br><br>
First of all - sucesfully finish the race,
<br><br>
Then went to prioritizing winning the race,
<br><br>
And finally, possibly sabotage if it doesn't affect ourselves (speed, winning, etc).
<br><br>
We quickly decided to divide into two persons on each stand. One group building and one
group programming. This was meant to organize us better, and let one group be experts at
one thing at a time. This method worked really well and we shuffled the roles from time to
time.
<br><br>
With our main goals in mind, we put lots of effort in building the best possible tracking system by
utilizing the color sensor, and developing the most failproof and optimized line-tracking code we could.
Personally i spent most of my time as a programmer in the team, since my longer experience in the field.
This allowed me to be helpful for the other team members in the learning process.
<br><br>
We sucesfully made a really good tracking system using two color sensors. This allowed us to start on
our mission of sabotage, where our plan was to make a lift that would throw random black LEGO pieces
to throw off the oponents sensors.

SLUTTEN!
