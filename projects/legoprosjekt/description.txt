This asignment as previously mentioned, was about creating and controlling a LEGO EV3 Mindstorm robot
in Python to fulfill a series of different sub-asignments and then participate in the IDI-Rally. The IDI-Rally was
a tournament of racing on a fixed lane by using different sensors. Here we would build our robots to
potentially outsmart other teams with traps and other methods of sabotage.
