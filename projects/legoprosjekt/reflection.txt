Through this assignment, i learned the basics of team collaboration
and the principles of good teamwork, meaning how it's possible to arrange
things so that a team can do work effectively, while also helping each other
out underways.

This experience was a really nice way of introducing me into the everyday of
most developers, namely collaboration over one common goal.
<br>
Not only that, but i drastically refined my Python knowledge, which was important
in the diverse other subjects that we have. I'm also really happy about my
function as a teacher, where people with none previous experience could quickly
start to develop code on their own.

I've always liked to work alone, where i would precisely know what is wrong and what
should be done. Nonetheless, this assignment showed me that i was totally wrong,
whereas a huge assignment that would normally be really stressfull, could become
such a fun and great learning process, just by collaborating over that one goal.
