Despite being a quick pased subject as i described earlier, i have loved the Java programming
language for years now. Developing code has not been anything new for me, but i
surely has got a new perspective, grasp and orientation over the subject. I've learned complex
methods and working ethics for coding, which enables working later in teams with structure. Diagrams
and checkstyle have been amazing for understanding in depth the process of creating
things with coding.

I haven't added the final "exam" in Programming I, because at the time of writing this, it's still
a work in progress.
